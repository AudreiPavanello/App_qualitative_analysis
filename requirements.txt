# Base libraries from imports
streamlit
pandas
transformers
plotly

# Likely dependencies for transformers (especially with Hugging Face Hub models)
torch # Or tensorflow, but torch is more common with Hugging Face pipelines
sentencepiece # Often needed for tokenizers used by transformers
protobuf # Often needed by transformers/sentencepiece

# Dependency for pandas Excel functionality (based on the 'io' import comment)
openpyxl # Common engine for reading/writing .xlsx files

# Note: numpy is a dependency of pandas and torch, pip will handle it.
# Note: collections, re, string, io are built-in Python modules.
